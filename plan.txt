Just my general plan for this game idea.

Inspired by Factorio.

Start with having to mine basic resources (Iron Ore, stone, cut down trees, etc)

Refine those resources (ores to metals, stone to slabs/bricks, trees to lumber)

combine items to make more advanced materials:
Tier 1: single inputs (iron ingots for gears and rods, copper ingots for wire, )

Tier 2: Coombine single inputs with refined materials ()
